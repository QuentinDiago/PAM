# PAM: Prompting Audio-Language Models for Audio Quality Assessment
[[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00282)] [[`data`]()]

PAM is a no-reference metric for assessing audio quality for different audio processing tasks. It prompts Audio-Language Models (ALMs) using an antonym prompt strategy to calculate an audio quality score. It does not require reference data or task-specific models and correlates well with human perception.
